                <span class="font-semibold">map()</span>: This method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array. The original array is not modified. It returns a new array. <br><br>
    
                <span class="font-semibold">filter()</span>: This method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. The original array is not modified. It returns a new array with some or all of the original elements. <br><br>
    
                <span class="font-semibold">forEach()</span>: This method executes a provided function once for each array element. It does not return a new array.<br><br>
    
                <span class="font-semibold">find()</span>: This method returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.

            <p class="text-xl">
                <span class="font-semibold">localStorage:</span> This mechanism stores data indefinitely or until it is explicitly cleared by the user. Data stored in localStorage is not accessible by other windows or tabs. localStorage has a higher storage limit than sessionStorage and cookies.<br><br>

                <span class="font-semibold">sessionStorage:</span> This mechanism stores data for a particular session, which is deleted when the session ends (i.e., when the user closes the browser window or tab). Data stored in sessionStorage is not accessible by other windows or tabs. sessionStorage has a higher storage limit than cookies but is still limited to the current browser tab or window. <br><br>

                <span class="font-semibold">cookies:</span> TThis mechanism stores data as key-value pairs in a small text file that is stored on the user's computer. Cookies have an expiration date and can be accessed by other windows or tabs. Cookies have a lower storage limit than sessionStorage and localStorage.<br><br>

            <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mb-3">3.What is event loop? How it works?</h1>
            <p class="text-xl">
                The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows for asynchronous code execution and is responsible for handling tasks such as handling user input, making network requests, and running timers. <br><br>

                Here is a brief description of how the event loop works: <br><br>
                
                1. JavaScript code is executed in a single thread, meaning only one thing can happen at a time. <br><br>
                
                2. When an asynchronous operation is started (such as a network request), JavaScript does not wait for the operation to complete before moving on to the next line of code.<br><br>
                
                3. Instead, the event loop allows JavaScript to register a callback function to be executed once the operation is complete. The callback function is added to a queue.<br><br>
                
                4 .The event loop continuously checks the queue to see if there are any pending callback functions that need to be executed. If there are, it will take the first function in the queue and execute it.<br><br>
                
                5. Once the function has completed, the event loop will continue to check the queue for any additional pending callback functions.<br><br>
                
                This process of registering and executing callback functions continues until there are no more functions in the queue, at which point the event loop will wait for additional asynchronous operations to be started.

            <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mb-3">4.What is the purpose of quizTimer function.</h1>
            <p class="text-xl">
                The quizTimer function is used to implement a timer that is displayed on a web page. It takes a single argument dismiss which is a boolean value indicating whether the timer should be dismissed or not. If dismiss is true, the function will clear the timer using the clearInterval method. <br><br>

                If dismiss is not true, the function will execute a callback function at a regular interval using the setInterval method. This callback function updates the timer display on the web page by incrementing a count variable, formatting the value of count into minutes and seconds, and updating the corresponding HTML element. The function also changes the color of the timer every 60 seconds to provide a visual cue to the user.

            <h1 class="font-bold text-3xl mb-3">4.What is the purpose of chooseQuiz function.</h1>
            <p class="text-xl">
                The chooseQuiz function updates the user's answer for a specific quiz question. If the user has already answered the question, the function updates the existing answer with the new answer. Otherwise, the function adds a new answer to the answers array. Finally, the function calls the displayAnswers function to update the UI with the updated answers.
